		Designed to be run multiple times
	USB stick with Titanium Control Release 4 installer

Hardware Installation
	Niantic in outside slot
		For compatability with duplex setups
	2 GB SSD connected to first SATA connector from front of FRP
	1 GB SSD connected to third SATA connector from front of FRP
	Titanium Release 4 USB stick installed

# Power on FRD
	Press F7 for boot menu
	Select USB stick for boot
	All in one graphical
	Wait several minutes for install and reboot

# Log into console
	wrsroot/wrsroot
	Will be notified to change password
		Current password:	wrsroot
		New Password:		Wrs20!7cto
		New Password:		Wrs20!7cto

# Configure IP address - only if copying files from network
sudo ip addr add 128.224.82.246/23 dev enp0s31f6
sudo ip link set enp0s31f6 up
sudo route add default gw 128.224.82.1 enp031f6
mkdir patches
mkdir heat-templates

# copy the following files to the FRP
	license.lic
	frp-simplex-config.ini
	frp-simplex-setup.sh
	patch files to ~/patches
	heat templates to ~/heat templates
		Currently none

# Install patches prior to config_controller
# 	For standard setup, recommend patch 0001 through 0010
sudo sw-patch upload-dir /home/wrsroot/patches
sudo sw-patch query
	# Verify patches 0001 through 0010 available
sudo sw-patch apply --all
sudo sw-patch install-local
rm patches/*
sudo reboot

# Log into console and configure
	NOTE:  THIS MUST BE DONE FROM THE CONSOLE
sudo config_controller --config-file /home/wrsroot/frp-simplex-config.ini
	# Configures a common setup including OAM addresses
	# Assumes FRP is behind a firewall so the addresses don't need to change

sudo reboot

# Log into FRP

# Create directory in /opt/backups/images for images too large for home directory
sudo mkdir /opt/backups/images
sudo chmod 777 /opt/backups/images

# Copy the following files to /opt/backups/images
	Windows-Server-2012.qcow2 to /opt/backups/images
	Ubuntu-14.04-Cloud.qcow2 to /opt/backups/images

# Verify system is in unlocked-enabled-degraded state
source /etc/nova/openrc
system host-list

# For standard FRP setup
./frp-simplex-setup.sh
	# Note:	Certain parameters can be overridden and passed in "-f <file>"
	# 	Example in hudson-overrides.cfg
	#		OAM/external, 10 GbE NIC PCIe address, and whether to load images or create volumes

# When script stops and warns that compute-config-complete is required
source /etc/nova/openrc
system compute-config-complete

# Wait for FRP to reboot and reach the available state
source /etc/nova/openrc
system host-list

# Rerun setup script
# Run setup script again
./frp-simplex-setup.sh

Setup is now complete

ToDo:
	Standardize what wrsroot password will be
	What set of networks should be standard
		Currently created external and one public and one internal network for admin tenant
	Should there be any preinstalled tenants or tenant networks?
	Need to decide on OAM IP, subnet, default route
		Currently assume Rich's settings will be used behind a firewall for every FRP
	What is best way to copy the files needed to the FRP?
		scp files, rsync, scp tarball and extract, USB stick
		Total is currently about 15 GB (mostly images)
	Do we need to specify NTP for a simplex (what if not reachable)
	Are there any heat templates to create?
		Currently none
	For more automation, consider running setup script using remote CLI
